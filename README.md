# Software Engineer Assets
My own personal compendium of (mostly free) Software Engineering related resources, both technical skills and soft skills.

## Motivation
There are an exceptional number of resoures and guides out there already. A lot of these guides are language specific, and things learned in one skill may not be transferable to another framework, language, job, or project. The idea is based off of the idea of [evergreen skills](https://github.com/romenrg/evergreen-skills-developers) and the goal is to curate a list of high-quality assets which are as language agnostic as possible, such that spending time with any one of these resources can benefit you no matter what project you are in, or where in your career you are. 

This won't be an extensive list, and seeks to narrow down some the overabundance of resources available. Links to meta-resources and other curated lists will be provided for further study as there is a lot of benefit to these. 

If you have any suggestions, feedback, or other resources you'd like to see please create a PR.
